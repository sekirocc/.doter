Start Claude in an eat terminal and enable `claude-code-mode'.

If current buffer belongs to a project start Claude in the project's
root directory. Otherwise start in the directory of the current buffer
file, or the current value of `default-directory' if no project and no
buffer file.

With single prefix ARG (\\[universal-argument]), switch to buffer after creating.
With double prefix ARG (\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]), prompt for the project directory.

(autoload 'claude-code-start-in-directory "claude-code" "\
Prompt for a directory and start Claude there.

file, or the current value of `default-directory' if no project and no

Create a new Claude instance, prompting for instance name.

file, or the current value of `default-directory' if no project and no

Minor mode for interacting with Claude AI CLI.

When enabled, provides functionality for starting, sending commands to,
and managing Claude sessions.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Claude-Code mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the
mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='claude-code-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.
