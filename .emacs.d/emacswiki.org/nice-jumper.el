;;; Commentary:
;;
;; nice-jumper is an add-on for older versions of evil-mode (prior
;; to Feb 2016) which replaces the implementation the jump list such
;; that it mimics more closely with Vim's behavior.  Specifically, it
;; will jump across buffer boundaries and revive dead buffers if
;; necessary.  The jump list can also be persisted to history file
;; using `savehist' and restored
;; between sessions.
